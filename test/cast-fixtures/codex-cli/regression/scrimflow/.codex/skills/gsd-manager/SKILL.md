## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-manager`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-manager` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected (Execute mode), present a plain-text numbered list and pick a reasonable default.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Single-terminal command center for managing a milestone. Shows a dashboard of all phases with visual status indicators, recommends optimal next actions, and dispatches work — discuss runs inline, plan/execute run as background agents.

Designed for power users who want to parallelize work across phases from one terminal: discuss a phase while another plans or executes in the background.

**Creates/Updates:**
- No files created directly — dispatches to existing GSD commands via Skill() and background Task agents.
- Reads `.planning/STATE.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, phase directories for status.

**After:** User exits when done managing, or all phases complete and milestone lifecycle is suggested.

<execution_context>
@C:/Users/simon/Documents/GitHub/scrimflow/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/manager.md
@C:/Users/simon/Documents/GitHub/scrimflow/.codex/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
No arguments required. Requires an active milestone with ROADMAP.md and STATE.md.

Project context, phase list, dependencies, and recommendations are resolved inside the workflow using `gsd-sdk query init.manager`. No upfront context loading needed.
</context>

<process>
Execute the manager workflow from @C:/Users/simon/Documents/GitHub/scrimflow/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/manager.md end-to-end.
Maintain the dashboard refresh loop until the user exits or all phases complete.
</process>
