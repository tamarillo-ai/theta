## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-ns-workflow`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-ns-workflow` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected (Execute mode), present a plain-text numbered list and pick a reasonable default.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

Route to the appropriate phase-pipeline skill based on the user's intent.
Sub-skill names below are post-#2790 consolidated targets — `gsd-phase`
absorbs the former add/insert/remove/edit-phase commands and `gsd-progress`
absorbs the former next/do commands.

| User wants | Invoke |
|---|---|
| Gather context before planning | gsd-discuss-phase |
| Clarify what a phase delivers | gsd-spec-phase |
| Create a PLAN.md | gsd-plan-phase |
| Execute plans in a phase | gsd-execute-phase |
| Verify built features through UAT | gsd-verify-work |
| Add / insert / remove / edit a phase | gsd-phase |
| Advance to the next logical step | gsd-progress |
| Offload planning to the ultraplan cloud | gsd-ultraplan-phase |
| Cross-AI plan review convergence loop | gsd-plan-review-convergence |
