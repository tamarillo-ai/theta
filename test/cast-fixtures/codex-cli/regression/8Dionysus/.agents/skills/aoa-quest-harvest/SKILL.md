name: aoa-quest-harvest
description: Give the final promotion verdict on one repeated reviewed quest-shaped unit without collapsing skills, playbooks, orchestrator classes, proof, or memory into one layer. Use when a bounded quest-shaped work pattern has repeated, reviewed evidence exists, and you need the final honest verdict on whether it should stay a quest or move into the next owner surface. Do not use when the route is still active, only one anecdotal occurrence exists, the task is to invent net-new doctrine, or a broader reviewed session artifact still needs donor harvest, route forks, diagnosis, repair, or progression reflection first.

# aoa-quest-harvest

## Intent
Use this skill to decide whether one repeated, reviewed quest-shaped unit should remain a quest or be promoted into the next honest owner surface.

The output is a promotion verdict, not authorship completion and not acceptance
by the destination owner repository. It should also say whether repetition is
reviewed and isolated, reviewed but weak, contested, owner-pending, or still
too mixed for promotion.

## Trigger boundary
Use this skill when:
- a bounded work pattern has repeated and now needs an explicit promotion decision
- reviewed evidence exists, but the correct destination is still unclear
- donor harvest or equivalent review has already isolated one repeated unit
  from broader session residue
- the repeat signal needs to be distinguished from topic recurrence,
  conversation recurrence, owner-pending follow-through, or mixed donor residue
- the decision must distinguish between skill, playbook, orchestrator surface, proof surface, memo surface, or staying a quest
- the route needs a compact final promotion triage rather than another free-form discussion

Do not use this skill when:
- the route is still active and the evidence has not been reviewed yet
- there is only one anecdotal occurrence with no honest repeat signal
- the task is to invent net-new doctrine rather than classify a repeated pattern
- the repeated unit is still mixed with several reusable donor units, unresolved
  route forks, diagnosis, repair, automation-readiness questions, or
  progression reflection
- the repeat evidence posture cannot be stated without guessing
- the route is already clearly scenario-shaped and only needs playbook authoring
- the source is a reviewed session artifact with multiple candidate donor units that still need owner-layer routing first; use `aoa-session-donor-harvest`
- the source still needs explicit automation-readiness classification for a
  repeated manual route; use `aoa-automation-opportunity-scan`
- the source still needs explicit route forks, diagnosis, repair, or progression reflection from the wider session-harvest family before final promotion triage

## Inputs
- source quest or quest family
- reviewed run summary or harvest pack
- repeat count and repeat shape
- isolated repeated unit ref, or an explicit statement that the unit was
  isolated during reviewed harvest
- repeat evidence posture
- owner layer and touched surfaces
- difficulty, risk, and control posture
- residual ambiguity or reasons to defer promotion

## Outputs
- promotion verdict
- owner repo and follow-up surface
- explicit reason for promotion or non-promotion
- repeat evidence posture such as `reviewed_repeat_isolated`,
  `reviewed_repeat_weak`, `contested_repeat`, `topic_only_repeat`,
  `mixed_residue`, or `owner_pending`
- explicit statement that the verdict is smaller than authoring or owner
  acceptance in the destination repo
- named next artifact or next quest action
- concise note on what boundary must remain intact
- one `QUEST_PROMOTION_RECEIPT` using `references/stats-event-envelope.md`
  and `references/quest-promotion-receipt-schema.yaml`
- one `CORE_SKILL_APPLICATION_RECEIPT` using
  `references/core-skill-application-receipt-schema.yaml`

## Procedure
1. collect a bounded reviewed harvest pack rather than raw runtime state
2. confirm there is exactly one isolated repeated unit; if several units remain
   mixed, return to donor harvest, route forks, diagnosis, repair, automation
   scan, or progression lift instead of forcing triage
3. name the repeat evidence posture before choosing a destination
4. name what actually repeated: leaf workflow, route, proof pattern, recall pattern, or boundary law
5. reject theme-only repetition, repeated discussion, and aesthetic similarity;
   only repeatable work or repeatable law counts
6. if the repeated unit is a bounded leaf workflow, consider promotion to a skill
7. if the repeated unit is a multi-step scenario route, consider promotion to a playbook
8. if the repeated unit is orchestrator boundary law, read order, or allowed outputs, promote toward orchestrator class surfaces in `aoa-agents`
9. if the repeated unit is proof posture, promote toward `aoa-evals`
10. if the repeated unit is recall, writeback, or recurrence posture, promote toward `aoa-memo`
11. if repetition is still weak, owner is unclear, boundary risk is high, repeat
    posture is contested or mixed, or
    the destination owner has not accepted the work shape, keep or open a quest
    instead of forcing promotion
12. record the verdict with one clear reason for promotion and one clear reason against the nearest wrong target
13. name the next artifact as a proposal or follow-through target, not as proof
    that the owner repo has accepted or authored it
14. emit one `QUEST_PROMOTION_RECEIPT` when the triage closes, keeping the
    receipt smaller than the promotion packet itself
15. when the finish path closes, emit one `CORE_SKILL_APPLICATION_RECEIPT`
    that points back to the bounded promotion receipt and records one finished
    kernel-skill application

## Contracts
- invocation must remain explicit and post-session
- orchestrator class identity must not be promoted into a skill
- a skill promotion must stay leaf-workflow-shaped
- a playbook promotion must stay route-shaped
- proof and memory promotions must stay in their owner layers
- one good run is not enough to justify promotion by itself
- repeated discussion is not the same thing as repeated work
- repeat evidence posture must stay visible when repetition is weak, mixed,
  contested, or owner-pending
- a promotion verdict is not downstream authoring, downstream acceptance, or
  owner truth
- active quest state must not be copied into memo canon as if it were settled truth
- `QUEST_PROMOTION_RECEIPT` is verdict telemetry, not promotion authority
- `CORE_SKILL_APPLICATION_RECEIPT` is generic kernel telemetry, not promotion
  authority and not a replacement for the verdict receipt
- receipt corrections use `supersedes` rather than silent overwrite

## Risks and anti-patterns
- promoting a theme instead of a repeatable workflow
- treating repeated discussion, urgency, or excitement as repeat evidence
- hiding weak or contested repeat evidence behind a confident promotion target
- collapsing orchestrator class law into the skill layer
- collapsing recurring route method into a single skill
- treating proof debt as skill meaning
- treating memo writeback as active quest ownership
- forcing promotion just because the repeated work feels important
- presenting the next surface as already accepted by `aoa-skills`,
  `aoa-playbooks`, `aoa-agents`, `aoa-evals`, or `aoa-memo`

## Verification
- confirm the harvest pack is reviewed and bounded
- confirm exactly one repeated reviewed unit is isolated before final triage
- confirm repeat evidence posture is named and supports the verdict
- confirm the repeated unit is named explicitly
- confirm the chosen promotion target matches the owner layer
- confirm the nearest wrong target is explicitly rejected
- confirm class identity is not being defined by quest metadata
- confirm the result is one of the allowed outcomes: keep or open quest, skill, playbook, orchestrator surface, proof surface, or memo surface
- confirm the next artifact is framed as a proposal or follow-through target,
  not as downstream owner acceptance
- confirm any emitted receipt stays evidence-linked and subordinate to the closed triage
- confirm any emitted `CORE_SKILL_APPLICATION_RECEIPT` points to the
  promotion detail receipt and stays finish-only

## Adaptation points
Project overlays may add:
- local quest IDs and harvest entrypoints
- local owner-repo route maps
- local review packet or acceptance surfaces
- local memo and eval references
- local stop conditions for when promotion must remain deferred
- local destination-owner acceptance checks that happen after this verdict and
  outside the skill itself
- local repeat evidence posture vocabulary, provided it still distinguishes
  reviewed isolated repetition from weak, contested, topic-only, mixed, or
  owner-pending repetition
